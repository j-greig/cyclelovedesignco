<!-- ## A concrete plan for making your website better. -->

Is your marketing website looking a little... neglected? Maybe the design or copy on your website isn’t right, but you can't quite put your finger on why? Or maybe you just need a fresh pair of eyes and an honest appraisal?

For 15 years I’ve worked with clients like Google, Topshop and Guggenheim to design and build websites — and I’d love to help improve your website too.

Galvanise was created with one task in mind: to help you figure out what isn’t working about your current website, and how to fix it.

&nbsp;
## How Galvanise works

First we’ll spend 30 minutes on Skype reviewing your website (up to three key pages) and your business objectives.

Then I'll create a written report with at least 1,000 words of actionable advice on improving your website, with analysis of its design, copywriting and SEO.

Lastly, you’ll receive a list of at least twelve “no-brainers” — things you can change right away to improve your website, from the labels on buttons, to inconsistent design elements, to layout and content suggestions.

&nbsp;
## Ready to energise your website?

If you want an easy-to-follow, tailored report that will guide you to a better website, you’re in the right place.

    <blockquote class="i lh-copy measure">"Sometimes when you work with something everyday, you can't see the forest for the trees — Galvanise gave us an expert outside analysis of how our website was and wasn't working. (The SEO overview was an unexpected bonus too… it's not something I ever thought of working on before, even knowing that most people find us via search). James really thought about our business. His suggestions were straightforward and easy to implement, and felt passionate about the work that we do."<br>—Jenni Gwiazdowski, London Bike Kitchen</blockquote>

## About me

Since 2003, I’ve worked as a digital designer with fashion clients like Whistles, Topshop and Mackintosh, with art institutions like Tate, Guggenheim and Astrup Fearnley, as well as cycling brands like Vulpine and Saffron Frameworks.

My writing on this blog and as [CycleLove][0] has given me a unique understanding of content strategy — that is to say, how to create highly engaging content that attracts the right kind of eyeballs to your website.

&nbsp;
## Still have questions?

Firstly, thank you for reading this far.

[Please drop me a line with your question][1] and I’ll be in touch as soon as I can.
